 *
 * This header provide macros that uses either std::auto_ptr or
 * its C++11 counterpart std::unique_ptr when trex was compiled with 
 * C++11 support
 *
 * It provide two macros that allow to handle unique pointers as if 
 * their implementation was @e relativelly similar to C++11 specs. 
 * Specifically it provides a macro to get the preferred type for 
 * unique pointers and a macro to move the pointer from one instance 
 * to another
 *
 * @note It is recommended to replace all references to the standard 
 *   memory header by this header
