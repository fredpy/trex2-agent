/** @defgroup plugins plug-ins
 * @brief The set of plug-ins provided in the distribution
 *
 * This module list all the plug-ins provided as exemple or extensions of TREX.
 * None of them are really required but they give an illustration on how to 
 * implement TREX extensions or give the ability to use TREX fully with both 
 * planning and execution without having to implement your own deliberative 
 * reactor (@ref europa) or visual interface (@ref vitre).
