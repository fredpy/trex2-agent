\label{sec:exp}

{\em\color{gray} Need to present here both practical results that illustrates the outcome of our solution and how it benefits ... eg show a casewhere new goals are introduced as we go along}

{\em\color{gray} Also need some analysis -- potentially numerical -- on the overhead and impact fo both solutions relative to each other but also potentially to a more direct classic approach. 
To finally discuss why one solution was preferred on our system}
