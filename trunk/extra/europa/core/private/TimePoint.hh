       *
       * This class is used by T-REX to inject timepoints in the plan database 
       * reflecting the advance of time within a token.
       * 
       * In general this time point is related to the execution frontier 
       * (or current tick) as given by the agent clock. T-REX updates these 
       * timepoints for each tokens to reflect their current evolution and allow
       * europa solver to porpagate these values within the plan. 
       *
       * For example when an External observation is still pending. Its 
       * corresponding token will be related to one instance of this class 
       * for which its value is greater or equal to the current tick of the 
       * agent. This timepoint itself is related to the token start and end 
       * dates ('start<this' and 'this==end'). As T-REX update the domain of 
       * this timepoint this result on the porpagation of the advnace of time 
       * allowing EUROPA to identify potential new laws or inconsitencies with 
       * its current plan.
