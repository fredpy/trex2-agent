/** @defgroup mbari MBARI specific extensions
 *
 * A set of TREX plug-ins which were developped speciifcallyfor MBARI 
 * applications. Many of them are including interfaces with other MBARI 
 * components not directly related to TREX but allowing TREX to interract 
 * within MBARI applications sucha as :
 * @li AUV control
 * @li shore side planning/mission support for vehicles on shore
 * @li gathering data from remote assets/sensors within TREX 
 *
 * @section Requirements 
 *
 * This extension adds a bunch of extra external requirements to 
 * be installed
 * @li @b RabbitMQ C client (https://github.com/alanxz/rabbitmq-c) this 
 * allows to connect to an amqp server and listen to messaging queues.
 * @li @b protobuf (http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/) the messages from 
 * out amqp server are encoded using this format
 * @li @b Poco C++ (http://pocoproject.org/) which is used for us to send 
 * messages to vehicles through Iridium satellites (http://www.iridium.com).
 * Indeed, the sbd messaging protocol of Iridium relies on e-mail with 
 * attachments and Poco library provides both an smtp connection API and 
 * support MIME mmultipart messages.
 *
 * It also assumes that you have the @ref europa extension activated
