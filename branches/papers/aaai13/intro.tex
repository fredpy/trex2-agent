\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

As autonomous robots become more robust and persistent, the likelihood
of receiving new or modified objectives \emph{during} an ongoing
mission is high. Generative continuous planning, integrated within the
robot's architecture, is one approach to enhance persistence while
dealing with evolving objectives and unanticipated situations.
Earlier works,
\cite{AmbrosIngerson88,Haigh98,alami:1998p820,mus98,chien99,mus04,py10},
have contributed control architectures, which embed planning engines.
They support a rich representation dealing with durative actions,
while ensuring partial plans are flexible for robust execution
\cite{lemai-chenevier2004}.

% such as \texttt{IPEM} \cite{AmbrosIngerson88}, \texttt{ROGUE}
% \cite{Haigh98}, and the LAAS architecture \cite{alami:1998p820} have
% all contributed to this field of research. Results from such work have
% lead to goal directed architectures that have sucessfully worked in
% the real-world such as the Remote Agent Experiment \cite{mus98}, the
% Autonomous Spacecraft Experiment \cite{chien99} and more recently the
% Teleo Reactive Executive \cite{py10}. Often these architectures embed
% planning engines that support a rich representation dealing with
% durative actions and resources while ensuring partial plans are
% flexible for robust execution \cite{lemai04}.  % A resulting consequence
% has been results in efficient approaches to temporal plan dispatch to
% ensure robust and sound execution \cite{mus98a,morris01}. 

While these approaches have been necessary to correctly execute a
\emph{flexible temporal plan}, they view the agent itself as
synchronously fulfilling goals provided a priori. They do not take
into account the introduction of new goals which could alter the
mission state and execution during mission execution.  Consequently,
the natural choice was to make the agent execute its actions as early
as the temporal plan would allow, so that the the robot would finish
its plan as early as possible providing more ``temporal room'' for
potential change in the plan. Such an assumption has proved to be very
efficient in dealing with unanticipated execution threats with an
exception in dealing with dynamic controllability \cite{morris01} ---
acting as early as possible keeps the remaining partial plan
flexible. Moreover, should the plan break, the robot has more time
left to identify and execute an alternate recovery strategy. An early
dispatch policy has therefore proved to be the most efficient
approach for the robot to robustly execute its plan when the set of
goals for the mission are fully instantiated.

Our experience in marine robotics shows that in a number of instances,
the full set of objectives of the robot is not known a priori. While
our missions last on the order of a day, it is often feasible to have
an initial plan that could be executed in a few hours. For example, a
typical mission can start with the scientific goal of collecting data on
an area for half of the mission and an operational goal to be at the
recovery location by the end of the mission. During this time, a
scientist receives and analyzes data collected by the robot, which
allow him to produce new goal(s) for dispatch to the robot, while
still in the water.  While starting an action proactively can often
add flexibility to the current plan, it can also at times negatively
impact the outcome should a new goal directly conflict with an action
undergoing execution.

In this paper we focus on a study demonstrating that strict execution
policies can present problems when new goals can emerge at any time
within mission scope; we are agnostic to the planning process
itself. We provide a simple solution that exploits temporal plan
structure to identify the execution policy of the next potential set
of actions. % based on the goals they are contributing to
% motivated by our domain.



% Our work is situated between the planner and the executive. Therefore,
% we are working with an already generated plan and are helping to determine
% an execution policy for every action. 
% The novelty of our work is twofold. First, we allow the agent to make
% such a distinction \emph{during} execution, for each action, by
% tracking causal relationships between goals. Second, while the initial
% approach is simple yet elegant, it is motivated by our real-world
% domain in the context of a continuously planning and executing robotic
% explorer with focus on execution rather than plan synthesis.

% This
% allows us to determine an appropriate dispatch strategy for execution,
% based on the nature of the goals this action contributes to. While our
% approach manipulates the plan structure, it focuses on plan execution
% within the agent rather than plan synthesis.  For the purposes of this
% paper, we consider planning in abstraction while providing an
% anticipatory approach to continuous robotic plan execution.

% The structure of this paper is as follows. We motivate with a
% scenario illustrating the problem of flexible plan execution, discuss
% previous efforts with robotic controllers for planning and dispatching
% for execution. We then present the algorithmic detail to enable the
% agent to decide at execution time when previously planned actions 
% should be started. Finally, after presenting experimental results, 
% we conclude and discuss potential directions for future research.
