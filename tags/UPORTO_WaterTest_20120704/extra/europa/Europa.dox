/** @defgroup europa Europa plug-in
 *
 * This module defines the europ plug-in which implements the
 * europa based reactor. This reactor uses Europa planner to
 * deliberate and executes its plan. 
 *
 * While not a core part of trex it is definitely a core effort 
 * within trex; this europa based reactor allow to use automated 
 * planning and plan execution all across an agent allowing for 
 * advanced model-based decision. As the europa planner is 
 * encapsulated within the reactor it also allow to distribute 
 * the complexity of the global planning problem by using 
 * multiple EuropaReactor instances interacting though their 
 * Internal and External timelines

 * @section Requirements 
 *
 * The only requirement for this extension is the @b Europa planner 
 * (http://code.google.com/p/europa-pso/). While TREX should still 
 * support anterior versions, we recommend to use Europa 2.6 or 
 * later.
 * 
 * @section Related pages
 * @li @ref europa_info gives some help on how to use europa within TREX.

/** @page europa_info TREX and Europa
 *
 * This page explains how to use the Europa planner within TREX. 
 * Using europa within TREX is done through the EuropaReactor which 
 * embeds an europa plan database and two europa solvers in order to 
 * synchronize its execution within the agent and plan for new goals.
 * 
 * In the following section we are going to illustrate some aspect on 
 * how to use this reactor and configure europa for each reactor along
 * on how to embed an europa extension (such as new cpnstraints or flaw 
 * handlers within TREX). 
 *
 * Most of this information require a minimum knownledge on how to use the 
 * europa planner and we strongly recommend you to start by looking to the 
 * <a href="http://code.google.com/p/europa-pso/wiki/EuropaWiki?tm=6">
 * europa wiki</a> and literature.
