Research in temporal plan execution is not new. However, dealing with
anticipatory dispatching has not been a focus of prior work in the
literature. It becomes important in our context for three
reasons. First, our system is embedded in a real-world robotic
explorer which can sustain itself for extended periods in which new
goals can evolve. Second, our integrated architecture \rx
\cite{mcgann08b,py10,rajan12} plans \emph{continuously} during mission
execution. Finally, the situated agent encodes plans in a rich and
flexible representation which allows such cost-effective inference.
While our onboard controller is influenced by work cited here, this
work is complementary to much of our earlier efforts.

% Dealing with plan execution is not a new problem and we can find a lot
% of work that relates to this over several decades. Still, it is
% pretty rare to see work that envisage that actions could be
% postponed except when this is necessary to not break the current
% plan. 

% Still, while this work contribute to ensure that execution time are
% correctly propagated within the plan with a limited cost, it does
% not directly address how to decide what value should be set for a
% given time-point in the scope of its possible values. More
% specifically it is still the role of the executive to decide whether
% it should start an action as early as possible or consider it as not
% urgent.

In \cite{lemai-chenevier2004}, the emergence of new goals triggers
replanning; most architectures handle emergent goals similarly, often
related to an off-nominal situation such as plan execution
failure. Prominent work in this area is related to dispatchability in
simple temporal networks (STN) so efficient temporal propagation prior
to execution encapsulates appropriate planning constraints
\cite{mus98a}.
% To do so, the STN supporting is transformed into an
% all-pairs network and stripped of unnecessary edges, resulting in a
% more compact temporal network that lessens propagation cost. The role
% of the executive is to select time-points within the current execution
% bounds and propagate its value within the simplified network.
When dealing with least-commitment planning this decision is usually
deferred to the plan executive.  However, the executive does not
address what value should be set for a given time-point from a
possible interval of values.
% For instance, in \cite{mus98c}, the executive has
% two responsibilities: the selection and scheduling of plan events for
% execution.%
% The executive needs to be
% highly reactive to function in a real-time environment with the
% resulting solution using a \emph{proactive} approach.  Doing so
% greatly reduces the plan flexibility, and therefore robustness, as all
% start time-points are grounded to a specific value compatible with the
% initial constraints.

% While this assumption is valid in most
% cases, our illustrative example demonstrates that it can lead to
% sub-optimal solutions.

% In order to avoid having a procrastinating system the
% overall agreement in term of policy is to start an action as early as
% possible (ref ?). 

% \fcomment{Therefore, one reoccurring problem of dispatchability is finding a way
% of balancing efficiency, proactive, with flexibility,deferred.}
% \fcomment{We need to update this to reflect that it is not ETS}
%There have been many uses of these two approaches when dispatching plans, as
%previously shown, but a compromise to one is most often used rather than
%a balance. Demonstrated in the tool MAPGEN \cite{bresina03} which used
%the Earliest Time Solution (ETS) for generating and displaying plans
%very quickly. Then allowing the users to manipulate the plan afterwards,
%getting around the problem of ETS generating undesirable plans. What is
%needed is a way of using both proactive and deferred together giving a
%balanced approach to dispatching.

%%%%
%% The following point has already been made in example.tex. 
%%%%
% While in the common case this might be acceptable it may become
% problematic when put in he context of potential new objectives
% emerging during the mission.  Take our AUV example, and apply the
% proactive approach globally --- assuming that all actions can be
% completed on their minimum time.  As shown in
% Fig. \ref{fig:ex:proactive}, the proactive approach allows the AUV to
% {\em Sample Vent2} before noon but as continue through the plan it
% results in the AUV getting back to the {\em Surface} by 12:21 and
% being stuck in the context of the current plan for the next 7 hours
% and 39 minutes. Should the scientist want to {\em Sample Vent1} the
% AUV will then be forced to re-plan accordingly and go back and forth
% between the surface and the locations all other again. By being
% blindly proactive, the AUV made its overall strategy less efficient
% than if it took the option to procrastinate at {\em Vent2} until it
% needs to get back to the surface.

% Deferring a time-point for execution is another approach for dynamic
% controllability with STNs with uncertainty (STNU).
\cite{morris01} proposes an algorithm that inserts \textbf{wait}
constraints within the temporal network during planning for any
uncontrollable event that may occur. \cite{gallien2006} also uses a
similar approach to reduce makespan. They do so in the context of an
exogenous event--such as the duration of a navigation task which
depends on external factors--where it is necessary to defer actions
for correct plan execution. Work in soft temporal constraints with
preferences \cite{khatib2001temporal} on dispatching has another
related approach with preferable start times. However, they are
plagued by poor performance \cite{bartak2002}. % ; while the
% complexity can be reduced to a more tractable (polynomial) solution by
% specifying preferences as convex functions \cite{rossi2006learning},
% this is still cubic in relation to the number of variables.
Moreover the solution proposed optimizes the plan {\em a-priori}
reducing plan flexibility leading to potential execution time failure,
which is not suitable for real-world embedded systems. In most
literature, the executive exclusively uses a {\em proactive} execution
policy motivated by the intuition that it will give more time in the
future should an unexpected situation occur. However, most such prior
work focuses on improving plan quality but does not consider the
impact of execution on the agent to handle unanticipated goals.

The efforts above decouple execution from planning, unlike our work
where planning is not only continuous, but execution is intertwined
with planning. Our interest is in deferring temporal decisions to the
executive to adapt the plan to new objectives without heavily relying
on plan-repair or re-planning solutions that could impact reactivity
in an embedded system.

% In this case, the deterrence of the execution of this
% time-point is enforced in order to ensure robust plan execution
% despite exogenous uncontrollable events. In \cite{gallien2006}, this
% approach is further discussed along with the Makespan issue while
% dealing with least-commitment planners which can insert unjustified
% waits within the plan potentially decreasing in turn the overall
% performance of the system. Both of these approaches show that when
% dealing with uncontrollable temporal constraints -- such as for
% example the duration of a navigation task which depends on external
% factors -- it is necessary to defer some actions in order to ensure
% the plan execution.

% An alternative approach is related to work with soft constraints
% within the temporal domain indicating preferences on actions timing
% such as in \cite{khatib2001temporal}. This should provide  a general
% solution for users to specify whether actions of the plan should be
% preferably started. One problem with general frameworks dealing with
% soft constraints though is their poor performances \cite{bartak2002}
% as the general problem is NP-hard. Even though it can be reduced to a
% more tractable (polynomial) solution by specifying preferences as
% convex functions \cite{rossi2006learning}, the  
% complexity is still cubic in relation to the number of
% variables. Moreover the solutions proposed do optimize the plan {\em
%   a-priori} reducing then the plan flexibility which in turn makes it
% more prone to failure during execution.

% Our work on the other hand is more complementary to previous work, indeed
% while we do not really deal with dynamic controllability in our
% problem -- which can anyway be treated as in this previous work -- the
% core of our problem is not that much the observation of events during
% execution (which is more a observation related impact) but instead we
% are more focused on the knowledge that, within our agent, new
% objectives can emerge at any time, and we want to avoid as much as
% possible doing actions which are not ``urgent''. Similarly, while we do
% not really deal with complex preferences specification that can help
% improve the planned solution our purpose is to defer the decision to
% start to execute actions within the plan to the executive allowing to
% quickly adapt the plan without heavily relying on plan-repair or
% re-planning solutions that could badly impact the system reactiveness.
% By doing so, we take the risk of doing unnecessary actions as new
% goals need to be integrated in the plan.

% s
% considered to be deferred is related to the approach proposed in 
% \cite{morris01} to deal with dynamic controllability issue. 
% \fcomment{following will be included in former para. Also we need to
%   address that it is in fact outside of our scope here ... we actually
% do not address dynamic controllability, worse we tend to make waiting
% actions more brittle in general as we take the upper bound  for needed
% actions}

% The only work where we see 

% % Dispatchability for a simple temporal network (STN) has been identified
% % with whether a plan is capable of fast execution, retains its
% % flexibility despite uncertainty in the plan, and all information is
% % available at execution \cite{mus98}.  To accomplish the task of
% % efficient execution, the STN's are transformed into All-Pairs networks
% % and striped of their unnecessary edges, which will often create a more
% % compact temporal network and esse the propagation of its updates.
% % The executive then selects a timepoint, within the bounds of the 
% % execution time, and every timepoint before it has
% % already been executed. It then sets the start time to the selected
% % timepoint and propagates the needed changes throughout the graph
% % \cite{mus98}. The process of selecting a timepoint can lead to
% % issues when two timepoints have the possibility of being executed at the
% % same time, where one should necessarily come first, but the incorrect
% % one gets selected first. This mistake can cause the STN to become
% % brittle, which leads to a higher chance of failure in the plan.

% % \fcomment{Need to continue to refine from here and talk about STNU and
% %   morris01 as  the only approach we know of where postponed events are present
% %   though the inserted wait}

% % Take our shopping example\fcomment{figure again}.  We'll say the agent wakes up
% % at 9 AM and the duration for traveling to the store is forty minutes
% % and buying the apples is ten minutes. Using the proactive approach, the
% % agent will start shopping as soon as possible and thus be done shopping
% % by 10 AM. The agent will then go directly home afterwards to satisfy the
% % ``home by 8 PM'' goal. However by doing so, the agent will be back
% % home by 11am with the constraint to stay at home for the next 9
% % hours. 
% % \fhighlight{If his wife} is then calling to ask him to buy extra things it will
% % results on hime to need to fully relax his current plan and go back
% % and forth between its home and the store all other again. By being
% % fully proactive the agent.\fcomment{Maybe what was meant initially
% % here is more related to dynamic controllability which mean that I need
% % to twek this text to be more related to a modelled
% % but uncontrolbale situation.}


% % However, the start time for this goal will be roughly
% % 11 AM, and if the agent wants to get some dessert before dinner it will
% % cause a failure in the plan. What this example shows is how EST can
% % severely reduce the flexibility of a mission. EST can also cause
% % inconsistency within the plan.

%  {\em \fhighlight{Therefore,} \cite{mus97}\fcomment{See comment before} added
% implied links between timepoints allowing the planner to find them
% efficiently.\fcomment{I don't get what you mean here}}


% Another issue with execution is uncertainty in the plan. The above
% example illustrates the uncertainty about when the agent should go home
% or if the agent will want to buy more food during the mission. A
% solution for execution uncertainty is the least-committed method, which
% waits until that last moment to execute events. This approach keeps the
% plans flexibility and it allows the executive to have all of the
% available information before making a choice (Block, 2006). However, it
% has been argued that the least-committed method is an inefficient
% solution because in a real-world environment an agent might idle for
% long periods of time (Gallien, 2006). This can severely decrease the
% overall performance of the system. Lets demonstrate the least-committed
% policy in our Shopping agent example using the same goals and durations
% as before. This time around the agent won't want to do anything until it
% is absolutely necessary to do it. The agent will then wait until 6:20 PM
% before leaving and will finish shopping at 7:20 PM this way the agent
% can be home by 8 PM. However, even though this keeps flexibility in the
% plan there are a few issues. If there happens to be traffic then the
% agent might not make it home by eight PM. Also the agent procrastinates
% all day just waiting to go shopping rather than starting early on in the
% day, which wastes valuable time. Their (Gallien, 2006) solution is to
% change the planning heuristic altering how their plan is created
% inevitably adjusting it for faster execution.
