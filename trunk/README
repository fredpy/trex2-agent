TREX version used at MBARI. 

This version is slightly different from the one to google code in some aspects :
     - google code version is so far tied to Europa and uses the most recent version of this planner 
       while this one will try gradually to be independent from Europa.  
     - google code version sepcifies as its core what should be a behavior (with interesting improvements) while this one abstract this aspect as for now and instead provide more flexibilty on the status of a timline (Internal/Private/External/Observe instead of Internal/External) 
     - both are providing different way of debugging a plan execution which started to diverge in term odf diasplay and entilment to Europa (latest thing I saw was using PlanWorks which is good but may be problemeatic if we use different planners).
