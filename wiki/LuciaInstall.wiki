Installation instructions for Lucia winter school 2013


= Introduction =

In order to install T-REX for the Lucia winter school you will need the following:
  * A ubuntu linux box 12.04 64 bits
  * administration rights in the box
  * ROS hydra installed

Additionally you will need europa_pso which is provided.
It is also recommended to have ccmake or cmake-gui installed as this documentation assume that you have at least ccmake (cmake-gui being just the more fancy version of it). To install 

For installing ccmake:
{{{ $ sudo apt-get install cmake-curses-gui }}}
Or for installing cmake-gui
{{{ $ sudo apt-get install cmake-qt-gui }}}

= Installing Europa =

 # Download the [http://code.google.com/p/trex2-agent/downloads/detail?name=europa-ubuntu-12.10-64.tar.gz&can=2&q= binary]
 # Install antlr3c on ubuntu
   {{{ 
$ sudo apt-get install libantlr3c-3.2.0 libantlr3c-dev 
   }}}
 # Unpack the europa archive 
   {{{
$ cd ~/
$ tar zxvf europa-ubuntu-12.10-64.tar.gz
   }}}
After this you should have a ~/europa directory which include all the europa binaries and headers required for T-REX compilation.
  
= Installing T-REX =
 # Get the source of T-REX [http://code.google.com/p/trex2-agent/downloads/detail?name=trex-0.5.1.tar.gz&can=2&q= here]  
 # unpack the source 
    {{{
$ cd ~/
$ tar zxvf trex-0.5.1.tar.gz
    }}}
 # Set EUROPA_HOME to where europa was unpacked
   {{{
$ export EUROPA_HOME=~/europa
   }}}
 # Create build directory and run ccmake (alt.cmake-gui on it) with the source location as argument
    {{{ 
$ mkdir ~/trex.build
$ cd ~/trex.build
$ ccmake ~/trex-0.5.1 -DWITH_CPP11=ON
   }}}
*Note* the WITH_CPP11 option is required as ubuntu 12.xx uses a version of boost anterior to 1.47. Setting it up beforehand avoid to have the trex cmake scripts  display an error message.

At this point you should be facing an interface similar to this:

Hit the key 'c' (or the configure button on cmake-gui) to do the first configuration:
