Installing TREX

1) Third party requirements

TREX uses third party utilities and libraries. Here's sa list of them :
 - jam (http://www.perforce.com/jam/jam.html) This is a make replacement     
       utility used to compile TREX.
 - rapidXML (http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/) This is used for configuration 
            parsing. TREX used to rely on TinyXML version embedded in Europa
            but keeping this would have been annoying as this version was part
            of Europa and keeping the ability to connect to Europa while using
            a version of TinyXML which is not necessarily the Europa one would
            have been tricky. On top of that rapidxml is really lightweight
            (only templates defined in C++ headers) and very fast (performance
            close to strlen).
 - boost (http://www.boost.org) This library is widely used for basic
         utilities and compatibilty with the TR1 C++0x standard.
	 version 1.40 or above (tested against 1.40 up to 1.46) 

Other utilies are of interrest but not necessary to use TREX:
 - doxygen (http://www.doxygen.org/) This utility is needed only if you want 
           to generate this documentation.
 - graphviz (http://www.graphviz.org/) Recommended for documentation but it 
            may also be used for plan visualization by showing tokens and 
            their relations as a graph.

For europa plug-in :
  - europa-pso (http://code.google.com/p/europa-pso/) version 2.4 or above.
               this is the core libaray used for planning on the EuropaReactor
	       Simply install the binary distribution provided for your platform
	       Note : Europa does not compile on gcc 4.3 and above. Because of
	       	      this make sure that your version of gcc is 4.1.x or 4.2.x

Note:
  rapidxml is bundled into TREX. Nothing as been changed in this libray and if
  one prefers to use another version of this library he justs need to define 
  the environment variable TINY_XML_ROOT with the directory where this one is 
  before compiling TREX.

2) Set your environment

The devConfig bash file loads all the variables needed to be able to
compile and execute TREX. If you are using bash you can edit your
~/.profile (or ~/.bash_profile depending on your configuration/platform).
Considering that you have put TREX on the directory <trex-dir> you can put 
the following lines :
------------------------------------------------------------------------
path=`pwd` 
cd <trex-dir> 
source devConfig 
cd $path 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attention:
  Under MacOS X you also need to define DYLD_BIND_AT_LAUNCH to allow dynamic 
  library loading on the fly. Indeed, this version of TREX supports plug-ins 
  allowing to define externally new reactors and components and MacOS X needs 
  to be informed about that. To do so add the following line in your 
  ~/.profile :
------------------------------------------------------------------------
export DYLD_BIND_AT_LAUNCH=YES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) TREX general structure

This version of TREX is composed of multiples libraries and components which
are organized as follow (see doc/fig/SWarchi.png):
  - Main libraries: They are also called module. All of them are compiled into 
        the lib directory. There's 4 of them described more in detail in this 
        document :
	 * TREXutils : A set of classes that represent basic functionalities 
              that are used by TREX but are more based on generic programming 
              paradigms and design patterns that could be used for other 
              programs.
         * TREXdomains : Definition of domains and variables as manipulated by 
              TREX for information exchange between reactors. A variable is 
              defined by a name and a domain. A domain is a typed, possibly 
              continuous, set of possible values for this varaible. A domain 
              cannot be empty and can only be restricted.
         * TREXtransaction : This library define the reactors which is the 
              basic component that can be composed inside TREX. It defines 
              also Obsevations and Goals which are data that can be exchanged 
              between reactors.
         * TREXagent : Defines the TREX agent. The agent is the main entity 
              that manages the loading and execution of the reactors as their 
              interaction.
         * TREX commands: A set of simple commands that can be used to execute 
              a TREX agent. They are compiled into the bin directory. There is
              two generic commands that gives a simple illustration on how one 
              can create and manipulate an Agent :
	        - amc : This program takes a configuration file as argument. 
                        Provided that this file defines correctly an Agent it 
                        will execute this agent until its end.
		- sim : This program takes similar argument as amc. The 
                        difference here is that it provides a simple interface 
                        to run the agent in an interactive way allowing to 
                        step through clock ticks.
  - TREX plug-ins: These are optionnally compiled and the source is usually 
        located under extra/<name>. You can comile them by calling jam <name>. 
        The result will be put under the plugin directory as a dynamic library 
        named TREX<name>.
  - TREX documentation: Generated from the source using jam doc. It will be 
        installed on the doc directory.
  - TREX logs: Usually generated under the log directory after any run of a 
        TREX agent.
  - TREX utilities and scripts: Under offboard. Provides a set of scripts and 
        utilities to help the processing of TREX logs.
  - nightly build: Under nightly,. Used to run nightly builds of the head.
  - Configurations files Usually under cfg. A set of configuration files that 
        can be used to define new agents and/or reactors.

Compiling the core components (main libraries and commands) is done with the command jam.

Compilation of the plug-ins is done using the command jam <name>
