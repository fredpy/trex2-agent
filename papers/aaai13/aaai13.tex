\begin{abstract}

  Robotic plan execution has traditionally assumed that goals are
  articulated prior to mission execution. As robots have become
  persistent and moved into the real-world, the need to anticipate and
  capture evolving needs with new or reformulated goals becomes
  critical.  We explore this issue not yet described in the literature.
  We then demonstrate a simple yet elegant initial approach to this
  problem motivated by our oceanographic domain.  An execution policy handler
  is sufficient to disambiguate actions for dispatch
  within a flexible temporal continuous plan execution system embedded
  within a robotic explorer.  The resulting algorithmic complexity is
  linear in the number of actions and causal links of an existing
  partial plan.
