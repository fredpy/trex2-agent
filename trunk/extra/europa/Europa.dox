/** @defgroup europa Europa plug-in
 *
 * This module defines the europ plug-in which implements the
 * europa based reactor. This reactor uses Europa planner to
 * deliberate and executes its plan. 
 *
 * While not a core part of trex it is definitely a core effort 
 * within trex; this europa based reactor allow to use automated 
 * planning and plan execution all across an agent allowing for 
 * advanced model-based decision. As the europa planner is 
 * encapsulated within the reactor it also allow to distribute 
 * the complexity of the global planning problem by using 
 * multiple EuropaReactor instances interacting though their 
 * Internal and External timelines

 * @section Requirements 
 *
 * The only requirement for this extension is the Europa planner 
 * (http://code.google.com/p/europa-pso/). While TREX sghould still 
 * support anterior versions, we recommend to use Europa 2.6 or 
 * later.
