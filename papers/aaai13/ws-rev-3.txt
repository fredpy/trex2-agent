\f0\fs24 \cf0 An Issue in Goal Addition in Continuous Robotic Plan Execution\
\
The authors look at the problem of planning without completely pre-specified goals. Instead, the authors assume that new goals may be introduced during runtime. In order to solve this problem, the authors use higher level search in order to find an appropriate policy at each time step.\
\
The authors should consider dedicating more space in the paper to explaining their flexible temporal plan their algorithmic description. Both sections are fairly dense and difficult to read.\
