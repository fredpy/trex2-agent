\begin{abstract}

  Robotic plan execution has traditionally assumed that goals are
  articulated prior to mission execution. As robots have become
  persistent and increasingly moved into real-world environments, this
  assumption is not necessarily true; for instance a user can decide
  to give a new objective to the robot for inclusion in the plan being
  formulated, add newer goals or modified others queued for
  execution. In most systems this leads, at best, to suboptimal final
  plan trace and possibly to the exclusion of objectives. Either of
  which could have been avoided should the robot have executed 
  its initial plan differently.
 % As robots have become
 %  persistent and moved into the real-world, the need to anticipate and
 %  capture evolving needs with new or reformulated goals becomes
 %  critical. 
  % We explore this issue not yet described in the literature.
  We first articulate and then demonstrate an initial approach to this
  problem motivated by a marine robotics domain with an execution
  policy that is sufficient to disambiguate actions for execution
  within a flexible temporal continuous plan execution system.  The
  resulting algorithmic complexity is linear in the number of actions
  and causal links of an existing partial plan.
