\begin{abstract}

  Robotic plan execution has traditionally assumed that goals are
  articulated prior to mission execution. As robots have become
  persistent and moved into the real-world, the need to anticipate and
  capture evolving needs with new or reformulated goals becomes
  critical. We demonstrate a simple yet elegant approach to this
  problem motivated by our oceanographic domain, in the context of a
  continuously planning and executing robotic explorer and where
  metric temporal representations allow for disambiguating goals for
  mission dispatch. The complexity is linear in the number of actions
  and causal links of an existing partial plan.
