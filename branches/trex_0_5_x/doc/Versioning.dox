/** @page version T-REX versionning policy
 *
 * The version number policy for T-REX respect approximately the following 
 * patter :
 * @li major version indicates a mojor version of the framework. At the 
 *     current stage this verison is 0 as the overall system is still at 
 *     a early stage with many waspects not filly set in stone yet. The 
 *     goal is that starting at version 1 the core of the interfaces will 
 *     be mature enough to be considered as a stable API that won't be broken
 *     without ensuring backward compatible though deprecated interfaces.
 * @li revision number indicates anew vrevision of the system. A revision 
 *     chage indicates imporatnts additions/improvements to the system
 * @li patch number indicates patches that are more focused toward correcting 
 *     issues or improving performances without important alteration on how the 
 *     system works
 * 
 * We try to stick to this overal policy but as the system is still young with 
 * a small development team (and known users) the system evolution is currently
 * more burst based. This is the main reason whuy T-REX 2 main version number 
 * remains at 0 for the time being. It is worth remembering thta while T-REX is 
 * publicly available and is used on complex systems it is still a research 
 * framework used as a absis for our research on goal direct control for 
 * autonomous agents. For this reason the code can have 
 *
 * Should you find new issues (either compatibility issues with your code or bugs)
 * feel free to contatc us so we can discuss on how bets this can be resolved.
