# An Issue in Goal Addition in Continuous Robotic Plan Execution

Philip Cooksey, Frederic Py, Paul Morris Kanna Rajan

## Comments to Authors

This paper presents an algorithm for accomadating additional goals into a robot's plan, being sensitive to the need to not only make room for possible additional goals, but to also execute existing goals in such a way that makes it easier to achieve newly added goals. The paper is written in a relatively dense technical style, and would benefit from spending a little more time (for this WS at least) trying to communicate the intuition behind the algorithm. Overall the work is interesting and fits well in the WS as it is a clear case where AI and robotics work well together, and where AI can improve overall task performance. 

In terms of related work, there are other related examples of systems which can cope with additional goals being generated at runtime, e.g.

"goal to collects data"
"reduce Makespan" -> unnecessary capitalisation
