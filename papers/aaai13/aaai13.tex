\begin{abstract}

  Robotic plan execution has traditionally assumed that goals are
  articulated prior to mission execution. As robots have become
  persistent and increasingly moved into real-world environments, this
  assumption is not necessarily true; for instance a user can decide
  to give a new objective to the robot for inclusion in the plan being
  formulated, add newer goals, or modify others queued for
  execution. In most systems this leads, at best, to a suboptimal
  final plan or possibly to the exclusion of objectives, either of
  which could have been avoided, should the robot have executed its
  initial plan differently.  We first articulate and then demonstrate
  a preliminary approach to this problem motivated by a marine
  robotics domain. We do so with an execution policy that is
  sufficient to disambiguate actions for execution within a flexible
  temporal continuous plan execution system.  The resulting
  algorithmic complexity is linear in the number of actions and causal
  links of an existing partial plan.
